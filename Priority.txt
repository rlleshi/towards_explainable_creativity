Research Question 1: "To build a AI model to solve functional RAT"

Approach 1: "Three word intersection" 
- Done 

Approach 2: "Two word intersection" 
1. File name: conceptnet-local_embedding_search/depth_1/frat_2,3_conceptnet_search

Query: Flu, nauseous, Virus 
Answer candidate: sick, virose, disease, influenza, person

File name: conceptnetlocal_embedding_search/depth_1/embeddings/frat_updated_2,3_conceptnet_search_embeddings

See row 21 (only query words flu and nauseous) - this is because its true from the file from conceptnet-local_embedding_search

However what I wish to have is, considering "sick, virose, disease, influenza, person" as the complete answer candidate even though sick is not present between (flu and virus) or (nauseous or virus) for the query Flu, nauseous, Virus and the average similarity is calcaulated as 

sick            flu - sick 
                nauseous - sick 
                virus - sick
disease         flu - disease  
                virus - disease
                nauseous – disease
influenza       flu - influenza 
                virus - influenza 
                nauseous – influenza 
person          flu - person 
                virus - person
                nauseous – person
 virose         nauseous - virose 
                virus - virose  
                flu – virose
                
after similarly average is calculated, and the most similar answer candidate is chosen as top_embedding. 
    
2. File name: conceptnetlocal_embedding_search/depth_1/embeddings/frat_updated_2,3_conceptnet_search_embeddings
has an accuracy of 62.5 
but File name:
conceptnetlocal_embedding_search/depth_1/embeddings/frat_updated_2,3_conceptnet_search_embeddings
has accuracy of 98.5 

Shouldnt both have the same accuracy ? 

Approach 3 : "Path length 2" 

1. number of nodes (N) that "question", "reply" and "solution" is connected to (path 1) and number of N'(nodes from N) that these functional RAT query words are connected to. (For explanation why not considering 2 word intersection.)

Approach 4: "Word Embedding"
