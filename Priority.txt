Approach 3 : "Path length 2" 

/output/frat/depth_2/embeddings/ frat_3_conceptnet_search_embeddings-top10
top 10  : then why fewer nodes in "solutions" in some queries?
Like in row 2. Only 2 nodes are present in "solutions". 

Is there a thresold? What is the thresold we set?

So we look in ConceptNet the nodes (N) that is connected to the query words (wa,wb,wc) and then N' that is connected to N (where N' maximum length is 2). So there are only 2 intersection? 



Approach 4: "Word Embedding"

a) GLoVe
- Done 

b) Gensim
I feel the output has a lot of adverbs, adjectives, verbs. Like for example:
gensim/gensim_top15.xlsx

row 0 
Query : question, reply, solution
Top 15: answer, responsion, askable, interrogative_sentence, answers, answered, replier, answer_back, questions, ode_in_reply, catechetically, replies, answering_back, answerless, interrogable
See the nodes answers, answered, replies, questions, askable

Can we check this in WordNet to remove plural, past tense, adjective. In that case we can expunge those words (keep only nouns) and the accuracy should be good (I guess)

Only if possible. 


Research Question 2: "To build a AI model to solve structural RAT"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Output for full RAT. 
There was an error thrown only for path length 2. 


Research Question 3: "To construct Explanations"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1. Explanations are calculated from the file 
conceptnet-local_embedding_search/depth_2/embeddings/frat_3_conceptnet_search_embeddings-top10

column name "top_embedding" 

- chosing this file because of better accuracy. 

2. just for explainations -  All the explanations are constructed using undirected ConceptNet? In that case I want the explanations to be done in directed graphs. 
That is if a->b , explaination should be a is located_in b, where a and b are nodes and located_in is the edge name 

This is because, there are explanation like 
"hand is located in finger"
"finger is located in hand"
