3. just for explainations -  All the explanations are constructed using undirected ConceptNet? In that case I want the explanations to be done in directed graphs. 
That is if a->b , explaination should be a is located_in b, where a and b are nodes and located_in is the edge name 

This is because, there are explanation like
"hand is located in finger"
"finger is located in hand"
