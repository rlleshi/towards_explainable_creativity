4.b. frat/depth_2/embeddings/frat_3_conceptnet_search_embeddings-top10 / top 5 and top3
n this file I see the query word also in the embeddings column. I can remove manually, but there is no problem in the code right?
and also for that file I would need how many times the wans is in top 3 /top 5 or top 10

that is,
antler, doe, fawn - deer (answer is in top 3) - removed deer form the embeddings
bud, dandelion, petals - flower (answer is in top 5)
pedel, pull, shove - push (answer in top 3) - removed pedel

so the system provides that
2/ 3 queries the answer is found in top 3
1/3 queries the answer is found in top 5

4.c. Same for Gensim
and also for that file I would need how many times the wans is in top 3 /top 5 or top 10

that is,
antler, doe, fawn - deer (answer is in top 3) - removed deer form the embeddings
bud, dandelion, petals - flower (answer is in top 5)
pedel, pull, shove - push (answer in top 3) - removed pedel

so the system provides that
2/ 3 queries the answer is found in top 3
1/3 queries the answer is found in top 5

3. All the nodes that are connected to marsh, saliva, slippery (path of length 2) - just send me the output
