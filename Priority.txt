Research Question 3: "To construct Explanations"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1. Explanations are calculated from the file 

frat_2,3_conceptnet_search_top10_merged-True,_embeddings

column name "top_embedding" 

- chosing this file because of better accuracy. 


2. Gensim & Glove top1 accuracy


3. just for explainations -  All the explanations are constructed using undirected ConceptNet? In that case I want the explanations to be done in directed graphs. 
That is if a->b , explaination should be a is located_in b, where a and b are nodes and located_in is the edge name 

This is because, there are explanation like 
"hand is located in finger"
"finger is located in hand"
