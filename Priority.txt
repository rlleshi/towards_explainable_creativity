1. can you also use gensim to find the output. with this: 
rained_model.most_similar and positive being our initial test query and negative empty. You can print the top 10, top 5 and top 3. (For comparing with Glove and Gensim). So the top 10, top 5, top 3 should be checked with the ground solutions. 

2. all_embeddings_noun/top_embeddings_0.25thr_10topk
In this file I see the query word also in the embeddings column. I can remove manually, but there is no problem in the code right?
and also for that file I would need how many times the wans is in top 3 /top 5 or top 10 

that is, 
antler, doe, fawn - deer (answer is in top 3) - removed deer form the embeddings
bud, dandelion, petals - flower (answer is in top 5)
pedel, pull, shove - push (answer in top 3) - removed pedel 

so the system provides that 
2/ 3 queries the answer is found in top 3 
1/3 queries the answer is found in top 5 

4.b. frat/depth_2/embeddings/frat_3_conceptnet_search_embeddings-top10 / top 5 and top3 
n this file I see the query word also in the embeddings column. I can remove manually, but there is no problem in the code right?
and also for that file I would need how many times the wans is in top 3 /top 5 or top 10 

that is, 
antler, doe, fawn - deer (answer is in top 3) - removed deer form the embeddings
bud, dandelion, petals - flower (answer is in top 5)
pedel, pull, shove - push (answer in top 3) - removed pedel 

so the system provides that 
2/ 3 queries the answer is found in top 3 
1/3 queries the answer is found in top 5 

4.c. Same for Gensim 
and also for that file I would need how many times the wans is in top 3 /top 5 or top 10 

that is, 
antler, doe, fawn - deer (answer is in top 3) - removed deer form the embeddings
bud, dandelion, petals - flower (answer is in top 5)
pedel, pull, shove - push (answer in top 3) - removed pedel 

so the system provides that 
2/ 3 queries the answer is found in top 3 
1/3 queries the answer is found in top 5 

3. All the nodes that are connected to marsh, saliva, slippery (path of length 2) - just send me the output
