1) 15th June

1. fRAT 2_combination error. 
2. fRAT has_solution column having wrong 0 and 1
3. Path 2 solution compared with a Glove threshold to remove unrelated words. 
4. Relationship segregation (is_a) or (related_to) 

2) 23th June

1. Instead of using a threshold to remove unwanted words/nodes(solutions column) in path pf length 2 in fRAT, 
   order the words/nodes based on threshold value(highest to lowest) and then print the top 10 nodes. 
2. filter relation accordingly
3. update has_solution, accuracy
4. Relationship segregation (is_a) or (related_to) 

=== Finished up to (5)

5. Same for RAT


24th Jun 
Going through the output:
1. Row 50 - "Why FALSE?"
2. The explanations in the column name "relation" still have related_to or is_a. However not the way around.
