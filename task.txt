1) 15th June

1. fRAT 2_combination error. 
2. fRAT has_solution column having wrong 0 and 1
3. Path 2 solution compared with a Glove threshold to remove unrelated words. 
4. Relationship segregation (is_a) or (related_to) 

2) 23th June

1. Instead of using a threshold to remove unwanted words/nodes(solutions column) in path pf length 2 in fRAT, 
   order the words/nodes based on threshold value(highest to lowest) and then print the top 10 nodes. 
2. filter relation accordingly
3. update has_solution, accuracy
4. Relationship segregation (is_a) or (related_to) 

=== Finished up to (5)

LEFT: 5. Same for RAT

1. So use GloVe embedding to find the top similar words. 
That is, suppose the query is question, reply, solution, use Glove emdedding to retrive all the words that are similar(maybe with a thresold 0,5), and 
then the intersection and see the top 10. 

5th Jul
1. Oder the top_embeddings_0,25_10top file. The top embeddings column based on the similarity score. 
2. Check whether the top_embedding column has the answer from the column wans. (Calculate the accuracy)
