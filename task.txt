1) 15th June

1. fRAT 2_combination error. 
2. fRAT has_solution column having wrong 0 and 1
3. Path 2 solution compared with a Glove threshold to remove unrelated words. 
4. Relationship segregation (is_a) or (related_to) 


Update (1): 

2. fRAT has_solution column having wrong 0 and 1 --> fixed. TL;DR; a printing problem

Accuracy doesn't change, however, because it was just a jupyter notebook problem which caused the ground_solution itself to be printed wrong

e.g. "reply, solution" might have wrongly had "statement" as a ground solution, where it should have been  "answer". However, if "statement" happens to be in the solutions, then it is comes as "has_solution = False" because the true solution is "answer".

1. fRAT 2_combination error. --> fixed

3. Done
