1) 15th June

1. fRAT 2_combination error. 
2. fRAT has_solution column having wrong 0 and 1
3. Path 2 solution compared with a Glove threshold to remove unrelated words. 
4. Relationship segregation (is_a) or (related_to) 

2) 23th June

1. Instead of using a threshold to remove unwanted words/nodes(solutions column) in path pf length 2 in fRAT, 
   order the words/nodes based on threshold value(highest to lowest) and then print the top 10 nodes. 
2. filter relation accordingly
3. update has_solution, accuracy
4. Relationship segregation (is_a) or (related_to) 

=== Finished up to (5)


24th Jun 
1. So use GloVe embedding to find the top similar words. 
That is, suppose the query is question, reply, solution, use Glove emdedding to retrive all the words that are similar(maybe with a thresold 0,5), and 
then the intersection and see the top 10. 

5th Jul
1. Oder the top_embeddings_0,25_10top file. The top embeddings column based on the similarity score. 
2. Check whether the top_embedding column has the answer from the column wans. (Calculate the accuracy)

19th Jul:
1. Use template.txt file for creating a better relationship explanation for frat_3_conceptnet file top_embedding column. 
- The relationship should just be with three combinations. 
For examples: 
Frat: question, reply, solution
top_embedding: answer 
relationship:   question ----- answer 
                reply ----- answer 
                solution --- answer 
(0r the other way around). not required with other words in solution column. 

2. All the nodes that are connected to question, reply and solution (path of length 1) 


===
1. All the nodes that are connected to question, reply and solution (path of length 1) - just send me the output 


===
2. Can you also use gensim to find the output. with this: 
rained_model.most_similar and positive being our initial test query and negative empty. You can print the top 10, top 5 and top 3. 
(For comparing with Glove and Gensim). So the top 10, top 5, top 3 should be checked with the ground solutions. 

3. top_embeddings_0.25thr_10topk has_solution column is False. 

4. Can I have the similarity score of these following queries (the answer retrived via word embedding: GloVe - thresold 0,25 and 0,5  and Gensim)
question, reply, solution
antlers, dow, fawn,
bud, dandelion, petel
discuss, gossip, telephone
bench, sofa, stool
