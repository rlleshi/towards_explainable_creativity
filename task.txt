1. fRAT 2_combination error. 
2. fRAT has_solution column having wrong 0 and 1
3. Path 2 solution compared with a Glove threshold to remove unrelated words. 
4. Relationship segregation (is_a) or (related_to) 


15th Jun Task:
1. RAT 2_combination error. 
2. fRAT has_solution column having wrong 0 and 1 
3. Path 2 solution compared with a Glove threshold to remove unrelated words. 
4. Relationship segregation (is_a) or (related_to) 


2. fRAT has_solution column having wrong 0 and 1 --> fixed. TL;DR; a printing problem

Accuracy doesn't change, however, because it was just a jupyter notebook problem which caused the ground_solution itself to be printed wrong

e.g. "reply, solution" might have wrongly had "statement" as a ground solution, where it should have been  "answer". However, if "statement" happens to be in the solutions, then it is comes as "has_solution = False" because the true solution is "answer".

1. fRAT 2_combination error. --> fixed

3. Done



2) 23th June

1. Instead of using a threshold to remove unwanted words/nodes(solutions column) in path pf length 2 in fRAT, order the words/nodes based on threshold value(highest to lowest) and then print the top 10 nodes. 
2. Same for RAT
4. Relationship segregation (is_a) or (related_to)
