Task: Next meeting Thursday 

1. For combinations with no solutions we can take a path back. Like instead of direct connections, we can see for path length 2. 
cemetery, coma, noose : we can check for all possible solutions with path length 2 with all the combinations. 

2. Would be really helpful if you can make a separate column for relationship name without is_a or part_of. Looks easy, but it hard. 

15th Jun Task:
1. RAT 2_combination error. 
2. fRAT has_solution column having wrong 0 and 1 
3. Path 2 solution compared with a Glove threshold to remove unrelated words. 
4. Relationship segregation (is_a) or (related_to)
