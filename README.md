The Cosine Similarity between two word vectors provides an effective method for reassuring the linguistic or semantic similarity of the correspoinding words. Sometimes, the nearest neighbors according to this metric reveal rare but relevant words that lie outside an average human's vocabulary.

Here all the nodes are checked against the solutions and a cosine distance is noted.
