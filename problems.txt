1. (just for relation) When looking for bi-directions are we neglecting the complete directions (meaning making the conceptNet undirected?) In that case I don't want to make undirected, instead we can see whether {0} is connected to {1} or {1} is connected to {0} {1}{0} being the initial queries. So we can remove all the unnecessary comments like hand is a part of finger (since finger would be connected to hand) 

2. File frat_2,3_conceptnet_search(dept 1) - line 67 (drill, grave) - why no other combinations. same for line 47. 
when you see 46 finger, golve, palm: all the combinations are present. (Is it because only true value is printed?)
